**Cloud computing**

Cloud computing, often referred to as simply “the cloud,” is the delivery of on-demand computing resources — everything from applications to data centres — over the internet on a pay-for-use basis.

- Elastic resources — Scale up or down quickly and easily to meet demand.

- Metered service so you only pay for what you use.

- Self-service — All the IT resources you need with self-service access.
